    <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
    <p class="_large">An overview of the <em>Stack Overflow pattern library</em>, how to download and use it, how to write new CSS, examples, and more.</p>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>This library exists to standardize and inform the Stack Overflow product teams on the various base items, modular componenets, and views available to them to achieve their various goals. Not only does this allow the product team to work faster, but it also creates a consistent, on-brand experience throughout Stack Overflow.</p>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>All patterns within this library should meet the following goals:</p>
    <h3>Clarity</h3>
    <p>Elements should clearly communicate their purpose. High affordance enhances the user’s experience as their move toward a possible goal completion. Layout, motion, size, and color all help to provide this context.</p>
    <h3>Focus</h3>
    <p>Experiences should focus on the job at-hand. Elements are tools that assist our users to complete these at-hand objectives. Any unneeded element within an experience distracts and possibly impedes users from completing their primary task. Remember that we control only one aspect of the user’s attention. Other digital and physical media will distract users. All product views, workflows, and elements should clearly support the user’s primary focus.</p>
    <h3>Forward-Thinking</h3>
    <p>Product elements provide present status as well as communicating what could be. We do not build singular UI stills. Instead we craft conditions for the possibility of outcomes within an interactive environment. The medium reacts to the user and the user to the changing medium. This give-and-take relationship is contextually aware of the past and present, informing the user to potential future-scenarios.</p>
    <h3>Communicative</h3>
    <p>At their very core, all elements within a product are to communicate a message. At some level we are designing a conversation between various parties. We are attempting to convey messages or achieve certain outcomes. That being said, language is contextually relevant. What makes sense within one scenario may feel out of place within another. While one may not be able to design a fully contextual system, some thought should be given into what elements communicate to people at different points and within varying circumstances.</p>
    <h3>Transparence</h3>
    <p>As a person engages with particular elements, other elements should recede to the background. They are not devoid of importance, but lack meaning presently for the goal(s) at-hand. These background elements though should be transparent—not invisible. Users are completely unaware of an invisible interface. It simply isn’t there for them. Transparent interfaces though are thing we perceive through. The differences between the two being we can bring transparent elements into awareness without the aid of other influences whereas invisible elements require such aids. For example, using a “hamburger / menu” button to expose a menu is an invisible interface. The menu does not exist for the user until the view is influenced through a tool (e.g. the pushing of a button). A transparent menu might one present, but dimmed back or one that recedes when the user’s mouse is scrolling but comes back into view once the user stops scrolling. Transparent objects are free to move in and out of conscious awareness.</p>

    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>The core Pattern Library file contains all the base styles you will need. This is all include within <code>all.less</code>. When creating new view-specific files, you only need to use following two files:</p>
{% highlight scss linenos %}
@import "less/base/_variables.less";
@import "less/base/_mixins.less";
{% endhighlight %}
    <p>The <code>_variables</code> LESS file contains all color, padding, margin, z-index, and type variables. The <code>_mixins</code> LESS file contains type, gradient, and other CSS3 vendor specific calls.

    <h2>Contributing</h2>
    <p>Before contributing code to the repository, be sure to read the following sections so that your requests have the best chance of being merged.</p>
    <h3>Scope</h3>
    <p>There are three graduating levels of scope that determine where the LESS should live.</p>
    <table class="_borders">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th class="-col2">Scope</th>
                <th class="-col6">Definition</th>
                <th class="-col4">Examples</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Base</strong></td>
                <td>Core style which is used throughout the project</td>
                <td><code>base/_type.less</code>, <code>base/_grid.less</code>, etc.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Modules</strong></td>
                <td>Layouts which build on the core styles to create more complex layouts that are used within more than one view. Module LESS should be scoped to the components, leaving view-specific alterations withing the appropriate view file.</td>
                <td><code>modules/_tabs.less</code>, <code>modules/_navigation.less</code>, etc.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Views</strong></td>
                <td>LESS which is specific to a section or view. It addresses overall layout. <em>Note: Folder structure here should emulate the project razor structure.</em></td>
                <td><code>views/JobEditing/</code>, <code>views/Products</code>, etc.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <h3>Graduating LESS</h3>
    <p>As a general rule, you should start with implementing your LESS in the smallest scope possible - almost always at the page level - then graduate that LESS as the scope expands. This is closest to how we develop LESS anyways.</p>
    <p>For example, I may create icons for industries on city pages, which is very specific to one feature of Careers. The relevant LESS would live in a page-specific <code>less</code> file like <code>citypages.less</code>, even if it <em>may</em> one day go to other parts of Careers. Perhaps after a few weeks, a new feature on Careers requires those industry icons. At this point, it's best to move the relevant code from <code>citypages.less</code> and into <code>shared.less</code> which is used across the Careers project. As a final stage, we may start thinking about using industry icons in Stack Overflow Q&amp;A profiles, and this is when you should put the relevant code into a pull request for the UI Kit.</p>
